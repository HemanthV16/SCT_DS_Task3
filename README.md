# Task 3 - Decision Tree Classifier | Data Science Internship

1. Task Objective
Build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

2. Dataset
Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

- Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing
- File used: `bank.csv`
- Rows: 4521
- Columns: 17 (including categorical and numerical features)

3. Steps Performed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset
2. Encoded categorical features using LabelEncoder
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Built a Decision Tree Classifier using `sklearn`
5. Evaluated model accuracy and generated a classification report
6. Visualized the decision tree

4. Model Accuracy
Achieved around **[insert accuracy here]%** on test data.

5. Learnings
- Preprocessing with label encoding
- Train/test data splitting
- Decision tree classification
- Model evaluation metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualizing the decision tree

6. Tools Used
- Google Colab
- Python
- pandas, sklearn, matplotlib
